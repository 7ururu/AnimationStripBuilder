AnimationStripBuilder

Small tool that allows you to compile your animation frames together.
It is very simple. You need to choose first frame of your animation, result file name, number of rows and columns in result file.
Remember your frame names must contain digits, because tool iterates through files with them. For example - frame00.png, frame01.png, ..., frames10.png.
And of course, if you want to divide result into few files, their names must contain digits too.
