Animation Smart Builder is a simple tool for making strips from animation sequences.

Choose the first file of the sequence (files must be numbered - frame01.* ... frameXX.*), 
pick the place to put the result, enter the size you need and press Create button. 
You can also specify sprites order: from left to right or from top downward.
